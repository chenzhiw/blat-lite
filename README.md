# BLAT: BLAST-Like Alignment Tool

BLAT is a tool for sequence alignment.

This is a fork of the BLAT package (v35) written by Jim Kent. The package has
been restructured and stripped down to include only header and source files necessary
for compilation. The header and source files have not been modified, however.
See the `LICENSE.txt` for conditions of use.


# Installation

There are no dependencies other than GNU build tools (e.g. `gcc` and `make`), and you can simply

    make
